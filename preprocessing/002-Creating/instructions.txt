This directory is generally filled with files that create the artificial movies and images that
populate the training, testing, and validation sets that we use for the neural networks.

Stack_Testing.py isn't involved in the larger pipeline. I was using it more to look at how different
stacking algorithms work. I threw it in because it saves the stacked images to a local directory,
so it's helpful for quickly testing out different methods, which I thought you might appreciate as
I'm not entirely happy with the current method of stacking (especially with how it stacks in the 
X and Y directions).

Stack_Dataset.py takes a hdf5 file of 3d-aerogel movies and creates an hdf5 file of stacked images
in all 3 directions.

GetSomeImages.py is used to download a few movies from an hdf5 file on the Linux machine. This was 
helpful for me because I was predominantly working from my laptop, so with this I didn't have to 
do screen sharing to visually check that the hdf5 file I created actually looks ok.

makeWholeDataset.py is used to create a hdf5 file with 3D movies. It uses some convenient functions
from construct.py, which generally has functions that help with loading in movies and pasting tracks.
